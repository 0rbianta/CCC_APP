# Android Color Change Calculation App

An application that creates arithmetic means from frames and saves them to a log file. It also converts color space of the frames. Target of doing an app like that is following changes on camera input by getting numeric results and using only Android system.

Requirements:
* Full R/W access on external storage
* Camera access permission
* SDK level upper then 26(Android O)

Sorry for dumb UI but I really tried to develop an application very fast so I didn't spend much time on it.
